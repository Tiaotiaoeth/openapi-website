## Subscribe

Client can subscribe different quote type through subscribe commmand.

Subscribe command [protobuf defination](../quote/subscribe/subscribe)

Example:

```json
{
  "symbol": ["700.HK", "AAPL.US"]
  "sub_type": [1, 2]
  "is_first_push": true
}

```

> Here is `JSON` for easy showing case, actually need using protobuf encoding.

Client can also check quote topics already subscribing, [protobuf defination](../quote/subscribe/subsciption).

After client success subscribing quote, server will push real-time quote data to client, data [protobuf defination](../quote/overview).
